Second milestone: Determine specific algorithms and data structures

Data objects/structures:
  PointNode : determines a point on the map, holds a list of points adjacent to it
  PathFinder : an object that works with the PointNode and the Map to find the path between two points
  Map : object which holds points inside of it and handles display

Algorithms:
  Brute force path finding : determines the shortest path between two buildings by brute force method, checks every route and chooses the fastest one based on distance travelled between the two nodes
