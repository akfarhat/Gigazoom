On-campus maps that will allow users to find directions between buildings using the tunnels.
The user provides a source location and a destination then the application gives written directions as well as drawing the path on the map. 
The application uses node.js and the express framework to make a web server with the data stored using mongoDB.
The client-side uses leaflet.js for all map functionality, jQuery for AJAX and some UI effects, and Bootstrap for the UI.
