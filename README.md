# Gigazoom

by Abdul-Karim Farhat and Andrew Belu

On-campus maps that will allow users to find directions between buildings using the tunnels.
The user provides a source location and a destination then the application gives written directions as well as drawing the path on the map. 
The application uses node.js and the express framework to serve the requests, with the data stored in mongoDB.
The client-side uses leaflet.js for all map functionality, jQuery for AJAX and some UI effects, and Bootstrap for the UI.
